/* Create a new Java project called TownChallenge containing a class file TownChallenge.java
with the following functionality in the main() method.
i. Define a String array called towns to hold the names of 8 towns of your choice.
ii. Generate and display a set of sporting results such that towns[0] plays towns[1],
towns[2] plays towns[3], and so on. The number of points won by each town
should be a random integer in the range 0-9. For example, the display of results might be
in the formâ€¦
Banbridge 7 Ballymena 4
Belfast 3 Newry 3
Coleraine 9 Enniskillen 0
Lurgan 5 Portadown 5 */

/* i. The application should read the eight town names from an input file called
towns.txt and store them in the towns array.
ii. Array reading the collection of towns, the application should ask the user how
many sets of results are required and accept this numeric value from the
keyboard.
iii. The program should generate as many sets of random results as were
requested by the user. Note that all sets of results will consist of the same
fixtures.
iv. All results (and home/draw/away summaries) should be written to file
called results.txt such that every time the program is run, new output is
added to the end of the file. The information in the results file does not need
to be formatted (i.e., as a table). */
